## Brief Notes
### Control Flow Statements
Break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling the program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code:
- Decision-making: if, if-else, switch, goto
- Looping: for, while, do-while
- Branching: break, continue, return

### Decision Making
Require that the programmmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program:
- If a condition is true then a statement or statements are executed.
- If a condition is false the other statements are executed.
  
Alternative: condition ? expression1 : expression2

### Looping
- If is required to execute a block of code several number of times.
- When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed (break and continue).
