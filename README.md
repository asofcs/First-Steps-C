## Brief Notes

### Arrays
- Allow to group variables under a single name.
- An array is a fixed number of data items (elements) that are all the same type.
- Examples:
    - int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} *(all elements initialized)*
    - int arr[5] = {10} *(the first element initialized)*
    - int arr[5] *(none of the elements initialized)*
- First element: arr[0]
- Out of bounds error is a runtime error.
