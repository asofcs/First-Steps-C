### Linker errors

### Runtime errors

### Logic errors
Errors or bugs in your code that cause your program to run incorrectly
### Preprocessors
- Part of the C compilation process
- Identified by the presence of #
- Used to: 
	- create constants and macros with the #define statement
  - build library files with the #include statement
  - make more powerful programs with the conditional #ifdef, #endif, #else, and #ifndef statements
- Analyzes these statements before analysing the C program itself.
- Are usually at the beginning of the program source file, but they could be anywhere.
