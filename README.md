## Brief Notes
### Logical Operator
Also called Boolean Operator, is an operator that returns a boolean result that's bases on the result of one or two other expressions. E.g.: || (or); && (and).
### Arithmetic Operator
A matematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation on them. E.g: + (addition), /(division), % (remainder).
### Bitwise Operator
Conversion to decimal: Least significant on the right.
E.g.: >> (right shift -> /2) , << (left shift-> *2), ^ (xor)

## Relational 
Used for comparison between two values to understand the type of relationship a pair of numbers shares. E.g.: != (not equal to), >= (greater than equal to)
